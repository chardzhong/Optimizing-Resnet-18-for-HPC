# Optimizing-Resnet-18-for-HPC
This repository contains code to run time and performance measurements for the ResNet-18 model on the CIFAR10 dataset in the Colab environment.
Measurements include:
  Training, inference, and total time per epoch
  Optimal number of workers for DataLoaders
  CPU vs GPU speedups
  Time and perfomance measurements of various optimizers
  Time and performance measurements after removing batch normalization
